# HCI_Forum-week-9

I have manage to apply some of the Shneidermanâ€™s 8 Golden Rules to my updated portofolio.
Those rules are :
  1. Consistency :
     I manage to be consistent about how the layout of my nav bar which as at the very
     top where it make it easier for user to accesss. Also consistent about the colour choise throughtout the website.
  
  2.Shortcuts :
    I also imply some shortcuts into spesifics tpic that are shown in my portofolio by pressing the options on the navbar>

  3. Information feedback:
     There is a bit of information feedback user hover over the options in the nav bar.
     Also when user hover over the picture in the gallery it will respond by making the picture slightly pop up.

  4. Permit reversal of actions:
     This apply when user wanna see more of the gallery want to go back to the original page. This can be done
     by pressing home button at the gallery page nav bar.

  5. Reduce short-term memory load :
     By having 5 items in the nav bar it is safe to say that it doesn't take to much part of our short memory load resulting more efficient use.
